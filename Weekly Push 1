Project vision / pseudocode 
  Sound waves - white against black background
	    make function soundwaves, call multiple times from top of screen to bottom of screen
      Multiple appear then go flat 
     Sound waves disappear except for one at the bottom of the screen
  Snow (small circles) fall downwards, speed decreases as they reach the ground (bottom line)
	  make snow class
	    group together multiple circles as objects so they fall together layer by layer
	     start between 0 and width for x and 0 for y, until height of line (soundwae) towards bottom of screen,
		  when one objectâ€™s y position is ___, next object
  White dots above the bottom line slowly build up as Bottom line and space beneath gradually turn blue
  Snow fall slows down until one dot in the middle of the screen falls
  When circle is at the height of the bottom white line, line turns blue and snow above it disappears
  White line moves upwards until it is not visible and background becomes blue
	  as the line move, the single white circle remains on the screen relative to the changing background
  Larger blue circles percolate/ switch shades of blue to suggest ocean,
  Screen fades to black 
  A light circular shape appears, street light and then a street
  A dead tree with no leaves
